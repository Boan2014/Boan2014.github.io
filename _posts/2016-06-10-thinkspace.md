A great minimalist, writing-focused theme for personal use or project blog. **The front-page is the archives.** Typeface by ~~[DejaVu Sans Mono](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/dejavu-sans-mono)~~ [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) by and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).
