**The Plain** - just another white clean minimalist Jekyll theme that focuses on writing matters. Suitable for personal blog use. Made with [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) which automates the compression of the compiled CSS code, and cool **Jekyll layout** by [Anatol Broder](http://jch.penibelst.de/) for compressing the HTML code on-the-fly. The typeface used is [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla?selection.family=Karla) from Google Fonts.
