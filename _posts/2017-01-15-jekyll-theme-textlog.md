**TextLog** is the best minimalist distraction-free content-focused Jekyll theme. TextLog has a quite simple homepage; a theme with a brief introduction text (about the blog itself or the author bio) and then goes a list of written article/post titles. TextLog typeface is using [Droid Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Droid+Sans) from Google Web Font. Droid Sans is one of the best web fonts in the world for highest readability. TextLog post layout also supports [Disqus comment](https://disqus.com/) and [tags](https://heiswayi.github.io/textlog/tagged/). TextLog is licensed under [MIT License](http://heiswayi.github.io/mit-license).
