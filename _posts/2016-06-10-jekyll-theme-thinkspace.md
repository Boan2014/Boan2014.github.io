**Thinkspace** - a minimalist and white clean Jekyll theme designed for engineers to write their ranting and findings. It's best for personal blog or project blog use. Made with [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) which automates the compression of the compiled CSS code, and cool Jekyll layout by [Anatol Broder](http://jch.penibelst.de/) for compressing the HTML output code on-the-fly. Use typeface from [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) by Google Fonts and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/). [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comment supported.
