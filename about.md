I'm Heiswayi Nrird, or in short is **wayi**. Currently a Software Engineer at [Keysight Technologies](http://www.keysight.com), Penang, Malaysia. For more detailed look at my professional skills and experiences can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://my.linkedin.com/in/nrird) or [my online resume](http://heiswayi.github.io/resume).

This website/blog is a place I share my thoughts/opinions, some ideas, projects or findings. It's built with the excellent [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (the static site generator) and proudly hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (it's free!). The layout of this site is hand-made by me. The source code is available on my GitHub repo [here](http://github.com/heiswayi/heiswayi.github.io).

For contact, you may write an email to me at **hnrird(at)gmail.com** or ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HeiswayiNrird).
