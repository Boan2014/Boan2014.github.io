I am Heiswayi Nrird -- or **wayi** in short. Currently a Software Engineer at [Keysight Technologies](http://www.keysight.com), Penang, Malaysia. In my spare time, I experiment, code and build some stuffs -- some works can be found on [GitHub](http://github.com/heiswayi), [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/heiswayi), [CodePen](http://codepen.io/heiswayi/) or [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/user/heiswayi/). I also love to click with my camera -- [my landscape photography](https://heiswayi.github.io/my-photography/).

For contact, you may write an email to me at **hnrird(at)gmail.com**.

#### Colophon

This site (blog) is a place I share my thoughts, opinions, reviews, some ideas, projects or findings. This site is built with the excellent [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator and proudly hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The layout of this site (Jekyll theme) is designed from scratch and hand-made by me with a passion of simplicity. The typeface is powered by [Fira](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) from Mozilla. The [source code](http://github.com/heiswayi/heiswayi.github.io) of this site is available on my GitHub (don't forget to read the license note if you want to use it).
