### **Biography**

##### 2018/03 - present **Tokyo Institute of Technology**
- MA in School of Computing, Department of Computer Science,  major in Artificial Intelligence. 
- Research on Recommender System(Explainability), Knowledge graph Reasoning, Data mining.
- Academy for Global Leadership. Joint education program between Hitotsubashi University and Tokyo Institute of Technology.

### **Project**

##### 2020/04 - 2020/10 Smart City Takeshiba Project
- As my first project after I join the company,  my responsibility was to review the technical parts of the requirement definition of the entire smart city platform(City OS) which was selected as one of the three SMART TOKYO LEADING AREA by the Tokyo metropolitan government. Since there are not enough smart city platform implementation out there,  the biggest difficulty I faced is the undefinedness of smart city platform. we solve this problem by abstracting the whole smart city into output, os, and input. With correct authentication, the Lower layer can input the data through our platform API. Likewise, upper layer service applications or other smart city platforms with correct authentication can get the data they want through the API.

##### 2019/04 - 2020/03 Master Research
- Done several works on enhancing the explainability to modern recommender system by utilizing Knowledge Graph include paper accept by 31st DEXA conferences and best presentation award by The 170th Database Systems Conference and IEICE Data Engineering Conference.
- Keywords: Recommender System, Explainability, Knowledge Graph Reasoning, Deep Learning.

##### 2018/03 - 2020/03 NLP Teaching Assistant
- My responsibility was to improve the Tokyo Institute of Technology online course by NLP and data Analysis.  One main goal that has been achieved was to create a language model which can capture the semantics meaning of every online course. It is used to be Analyze the relationship between legibility and students' dropouts rate and the reasons for different popularity on the same topic.
- Keywords: Natural Language Processing, Machine learning, Deep Learning

##### 2019/05 - 2018/08  **Long Term Internship in Yahoo Japan Corporation**
- In this eight months internship, I improved the existed knowledge graph system quality by leverage the knowledge-embedding method.  Also created multiple datasets suitable for several research objects.
-  Keywords: Knowledge Graph Construction, Knowledge Embedding, Link prediction, Large-scale Data Mining

##### 2019/09 - 2018/12  **Hult Prize Titech**
